  Guides migration of a Spring Boot 3.x project to 4.x: preparation, the
  OpenRewrite recipe (UpgradeSpringBoot_4_0), Jackson 2→3 changes, Spring
  Framework 7, modular starters, deprecated properties, Testcontainers 2,
  and verification. Use when asked to upgrade/migrate Spring Boot 3 to 4,
  modernize an old project, or diagnose post-migration errors.

# Spring Boot 3 → 4 migration

> Verify the project version, official support policy and target release compatibility before planning the migration. Boot 4 uses Spring Framework 7 and requires Java 17+; select a supported patch release and supported JDK.

> **Java baseline:** Spring Boot 4 requires Java 17+ as a minimum, but **Java 25 (LTS) is the recommended target** — it ships final Scoped Values and Stream Gatherers, and virtual threads are fully mature (synchronized-based pinning is fixed since Java 24).

## Migration deliverables and stages

Use `analyze_project` for an evidence-backed inventory: module/root, Boot/Framework/Security/Jackson versions (declared versus resolved), Java/toolchain, starters, BOMs, build plugins, configuration and integrations. Record unsupported third-party dependencies as blockers rather than assuming the rewrite handles them.

Capture a baseline before edits: build/test results, startup/readiness, representative JSON requests/responses (dates, nulls, enums, errors, pagination), authentication/authorization outcomes and database schema/migration state. Preserve snapshots with the existing application revision.

Separate stages: (1) stabilize supported Boot 3.5 and remove deprecations; (2) mechanical dependencies/imports/configuration; (3) adapt serialization/security/integrations; (4) runtime and consumer compatibility; (5) remove temporary migration tooling. Inspect the diff and run the relevant gate after each stage. Stop on an unresolved compatibility regression; do not combine it with unrelated refactors.

## 1. Preparation

Before touching anything:

1. **Upgrade to the latest 3.5.x** and resolve every deprecation in that version (removed APIs can become build/runtime failures in 4.x):
   ```bash
   ./mvnw dependency:tree -Dincludes=org.springframework.boot
   ./mvnw clean test
   ```
2. **Dedicated branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b boot-4-migration
   ```
3. **Inventory** hot spots:
   - Direct use of `com.fasterxml.jackson.*` (custom serialization, mixins, modules).
   - Custom configuration properties (`@ConfigurationProperties`) and extensive YAML.
   - Tests with deprecated annotations and Testcontainers < 2.
   - Removed modular starters (see §3).

## 2. Automated recipe (OpenRewrite)

The `org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot4.UpgradeSpringBoot_4_0` recipe does the mechanical work: upgrading the parent to Boot 4.0.x, Spring Framework 7, Spring Security 7, modular starters, renamed properties, BOM migrations, and test annotations.

```bash
./mvnw -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:run \
  -Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-spring:<verified-version> \
  -Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot4.UpgradeSpringBoot_4_0 \
  -Drewrite.exportDatatables=true

# Review in small commits, never one giant diff
git diff --stat
git diff -- pom.xml
git diff -- src/main
```

If the project allows it, temporarily add the properties migrator to detect keys that changed at runtime:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-properties-migrator</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

Run the app, fix every warning it logs, and **remove it** at the end.

## 3. Structural changes the recipe covers

| Before (3.x)                        | After (4.x)                          |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `spring-boot-starter-aop`          | `spring-boot-starter-aspectj`        |
| `spring-boot-starter-webservices`  | modularized starter (verify)         |
| Jackson 2 BOM (`jackson-bom.version`) | Jackson 3 is the default; Jackson 2 lives under `jackson-2-bom.version` |
| Testcontainers 1.x                 | Testcontainers 2.x                   |
| Spring Framework 6 / Security 6    | Spring Framework 7 / Security 7      |
| Jakarta EE 10                      | Jakarta EE 11                        |

Other underlying changes:
- **JSpecify**: null-safety is declared throughout the framework. Parameters/methods marked `@Nullable`/non-null may now trigger compiler complaints with `jSpecify` enabled.
- **Virtual threads** remain opt-in (`spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true`); measure the workload and downstream limits before enabling them.
- **Built-in API versioning** in Spring Framework 7 (if you versioned manually with headers, review `/api/v1/**` in your mappings).

## 4. Jackson 2 → 3 (the most treacherous change)

Databind/core packages move from `com.fasterxml.jackson.*` to `tools.jackson.*`; shared Jackson annotations remain in `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation`. Review the recipe diff rather than blindly replacing all imports. What the recipe does **not** catch:

1. **Serialization defaults changed**: date formats and `null` handling change the shape of the JSON **without a compilation error**. Run the controller tests and compare the JSON output.
2. **Consolidated modules**: registering custom modules changed; check any hand-built `JsonMapper`/`ObjectMapper` (`JsonMapper` is `tools.jackson.databind.json.JsonMapper`; `ObjectMapper` remains under `tools.jackson.databind`).
3. **`catch (IOException)`** around serialization that silently swallowed errors: review the handling — the error model changed.
4. **Deprecated/removed Jackson annotations**: search for `@JsonSerialize`, mixins, and `Module`s registered via configuration.
5. If some third-party HTTP client still requires Jackson 2, keep its explicitly required Jackson 2 libraries isolated and let Boot's Jackson 2 dependency management handle their versions where available. Do not replace shared annotations blindly.

## 5. Verification

```bash
# 1. Compiles
./mvnw clean compile

# 2. Tests (with a real DB if Testcontainers 2 is in use)
./mvnw test

# 3. The app starts and exposes endpoints
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# In another terminal, after startup reports readiness:
curl -sf http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq .

# 4. JSON contracts did not break (compare against snapshots or controller tests)
./mvnw test -Dtest='*ControllerTest'
```

Compatibility evidence must include real endpoint status/headers/body comparisons, readiness and clean startup, security negative cases, transaction/database integration and independently released consumer contracts. Compiling the new imports is insufficient. Document intentional API changes and the consumer migration/rollback plan; do not downgrade an already-applied database migration during rollback.

Final checklist:
- [ ] Zero new deprecations in startup logs
- [ ] `spring-boot-properties-migrator` removed
- [ ] Response JSON identical to pre-migration (or the change documented)
- [ ] Testcontainers running on v2
- [ ] CI pipeline green on the target Java (25 LTS recommended, 17+ minimum)

## 6. If the project is further behind (3.0–3.3)

Migrate step by step: 3.0 → 3.2 → 3.4 → 3.5 → 4.0, using the corresponding recipe at each step (`UpgradeSpringBoot_3_2`, `UpgradeSpringBoot_3_4`, `UpgradeSpringBoot_3_5`, `UpgradeSpringBoot_4_0`). Compile and test between steps. Prefer staged upgrades when they help isolate failures; the sequence depends on dependencies and available recipes.
